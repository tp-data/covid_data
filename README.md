# Covid Data

> This reposity is around accessing covid data, and organizing it for analysis in Jupyter. Further more, this data could be utilized in a visualization software such as Tableau. We provide a sample Jupyter notebook, as well as a script to run and export the data in a CSV file.

## Context
<!-- <img src="resources/items.png" alt="drawing" width="300"/> -->
This data is pulled from an existing github repo, providing US data by day and by state. We can utilize this data to track total/new deaths as well as total/new cases for Covid. 

## Usage
1. You can utilize the export python script to pull the data for consumption outside of Jupyter.
2. You can utilize the Jupyter file to plot the data (sample plot provided for 10 states with most deaths).

# Source
The data for this script is pulled directly from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-states.csv.
